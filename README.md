This repository contains an almost complete compilation of the CSVs related to the COVID-19 Outbreak in Austria which were provided by the Austrian Ministry of Health.
The ministry's data is updated every hour, but - for the most part - does NOT contain any old entries which means that it is overwritten every hour. This is not an acceptable format for most purposes, so this repository aims to provide a timeline of the data.
