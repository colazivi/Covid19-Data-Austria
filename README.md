# Covid19-Data-Austria

This repository contains an almost complete compilation of the CSVs related to the COVID-19 Outbreak in Austria which were provided by the Austrian Ministry of Health.
The ministry's data is updated every hour, but - for the most part - does NOT contain any old entries which means that it is overwritten every hour. This is not an acceptable format for most purposes, so this repository aims to provide a timeline of the data.

For checking the data's integrity, please refer to the originals' backups at archive.org ( https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/data/data.zip and https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html )

## Directory Structure

/tsv/hourly_csv contains the data which was obtained from collecting and restructuring the ministry's hourly zip-files ( https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/data/data.zip )

/tsv/website contains the data which was obtained from collecting the twice-daily updates of the ministry's website ( https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html )

/tsv/ampel contains data relating to the 'Corona-Ampel'.

/dump contains a recently updated database dump.

/queries contains the SQL queries used for generating the tsv files.

## Format

A full SQL dumpfile is provided for people who have access to an SQL server. For others, there are a couple of TAB-separated TSVs hopefully satisfying most demands. The TSVs are compatible with Libreoffice Calc/Excel and similar spreadsheet programs.

## Updates

The TSVs are going to be updated on a daily basis. The dumpfile is probably updated about once a week.
